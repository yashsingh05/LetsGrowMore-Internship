# Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This project demonstrates an analysis and visualization of a dataset using Python's pandas, seaborn, and scikit-learn libraries. The dataset provides insights into various aspects of the data, and the code showcases how to load, clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset using popular data science libraries.

## Tasks Covered:

1. Loading and exploring the dataset.
2. Performing data analysis, including shape, info, and summary statistics.
3. Creating visualizations using seaborn for understanding relationships within the dataset.
4. Utilizing pandas and seaborn for exploring patterns between different features.
5. Applying K-Means clustering to segment data based on attributes.

## Contents:

- `dataset.csv`: The dataset used for analysis.
- `notebook.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the code for data analysis and visualizations.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook to understand the step-by-step process of loading, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing the dataset. The code is well-commented
